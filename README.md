# Django Project Setup Init
Every  time we have to create project with django-admin startproject. It's not good for a
developer. I think it's painful, that's why i create django project setup structure. Now
you pull it and create your apps.

I am useing rest-api framework django. That's why create Api app. You don't use rest-api
app, delete this app and enjoy.
